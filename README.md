GitHub Portfolio

MITxPro Github Portfolio


Description.
This project is for  MITxPro Coding Certificate program. 
I used everything I've learned in the front-end development of the program to create a Portfolio webpage


How To Run.

Yo can go directly to my webpage through https://olafunke007.github.io.git

Future Improvements
A later version of this project will include adding more elements and better styling as I improve and using frame-work and libraries I learn in the course as I progress.
